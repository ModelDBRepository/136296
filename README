This is a model accompanying the paper

A.R. Brazhe G.V. Maksimov, E. Mosekilde, O. Sosnovtseva "Excitation block in a
nerve fibre model owing to potassium-dependent changes in myelin resistance",
Journal of Interface Focus, (2010)

To run the model, use command 

./mnerve-gui.tcl sc1

Stimulation protocols can be added with "+" sign in the "Stimulation" frame. 

Click "Run" to run the simulation, click "Add plot" to make plots. Plots can be
also made from the output file (just an ASCII file) with any plotting software.
